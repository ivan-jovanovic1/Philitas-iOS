# Welcome to Philitas iOS app!

This repository represents Philitas iOS app. 

# Installation
 - Create free developer account on [Apple Developer Website](https://developer.apple.com/). You need free account to download Xcode.
 - Make sure you updated macOS to macOS 12 (Monterey). 
 - Download Xcode from [Apple Developer Resources page](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode) (**Downloading Xcode via Apple Developer webiste is way faster than downloading Xcode via App Store**).
 - Unzip and install Xcode.
 - Clone [Philitas-Networking](https://github.com/ivan-jovanovic1/Philitas-Networking)
 - Clone this repository (the app)
 - Open the app repository and then open Philitas.xcodeproj.
 - On the left side of Xcode, in the project Navigator, you will see Philitas->Packages->Networking. If the Navigator is not visible and you don't see files, you can toggle it using Command+Shift+J.
 - Once you located the Networking package, click on it.
 - On the right side of Xcode, in the Inspectors, you will see info about package location and the folder icon. Tap the folder icon, find and select Networking package. If the Inspectors aren't visible, toggle it using Command+Option+0. 
 - Pick up a simulator e.g. iPhone 13 Pro (you can select a simulator from Dropdowon menu at the top center of Xcode window).
 
 
The image below shows the project Navigator, the Inspectors and the Dropdown for iOS and iPadOS simulators. Note: I have `Philitas-Networking-main` instead of Networking in the project Navigator, because that's name of package root folder after selection in the Inspectors.
